    "Jiejie Wang, a Data Services student employee studying Applied Statistics for Social Science Research at Steinhardt, was interested in using natural language processing to analyze over 60,000 Twitter posts under the hashtag #BLM from June 2020 to August 2020. These tweets covered a lot of discussion about George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, protests, 2020 political candidates, and other related issues. This process of “sentiment analysis” enabled Wang to quantitatively analyze the reaction to George Floyd’s death, visualize the progression of how positive/negative language and vocal support for political candidates changed. The data and the analysis has been <a href=\"https://rpubs.com/jiejie/674009\">made available</a> as an R Markdown workbook.</quote>\n",
